//Accuflow Parameters
AdaptiveMode="This field is used to select the desired operating mode. When YES is placed in the window, it indicates that Adaptive mode (closed loop) is desired. A NO in the window indicates that Open Loop mode is desired. Should a problem occur with any portion of the Accuflow associated hardware, this is the mode of operation you may select to continue productive operations until a suitable time for repair becomes available. Normal operation of Acculfow is in Closed Loop or Adaptive mode mode of operation, therefore requiring this window to have a YES in it."
ToleranceMode="Percent tolerance band is a +/- percentage deviation allowable from the setpoint to enable the setpoint reached output. This value is applied to all flow rates where the percent tolerance value is greater than the minimum tolerance band. The default value is 1.8 %. The valid range is 0 - 99.9 %."
MinToleranceBand="Minimum tolerance band is the fixed +/- deviation allowable from the setpoint to enable the setpoint reached output. This value is applied to all flow rates where the minimum tolerance value is greater than the percentage tolerance. The default value is 5. The valid range is .2 - 10."
SampleAmount="Sample amount filters the incoming pulse train from the flow meter. Sample amount uses an averaging algorithm for preferential weighting of the old flow rate when calculating the new flow rate. The algorithm is as follows: Average Rate New = ([{sample amount-1} * Average Rate Old] + Instantaneous Rate New) / Sample Amount. The recommended range for this sample amount is 1 through 5. The default value is 2."
NormalGainMode="This number defines what amount of flow rate error AccuFlow will attempt to correct for in a single step when the color parameter Pulsing pump supply is set to no. Setting this number too high might cause instability while setting it too low will cause slow response to flow errors. Available range for this parameter is 1% to 95%. The default value is 90%."
PulsingPumpGainMod="This number defines what amount of flow rate error AccuFlow will attempt to correct for in a single step when the color parameter Pulsing pump supply is set to yes. Setting this number too high might cause instability while setting it too low will cause slow response to flow errors. Available range for this parameter is 1% to 75.5%. The default value is 70%."

HysteresisChecks="Accuflow will recalibrate itself at each color change or when a calibration is manually initiated. A hysteresis check will provide the user with performance data that maybe of use. This key should have YES in it, otherwise no hysteresis check is made."
LevelingTries="Leveling Tries is used only during calibration to ensure that the flow rate is stable before logging the sample point. For example, if leveling tries is set to 2, ACCUFLOW must read the same flow rate value twice within tolerance before it is accepted and entered into the calibration table. The recommended range for leveling tries is 1 through 5. The default value is 3."
CalTimeout="Calibration time out is used during the calibration cycle to abort the cycle if no feedback from the flow meter is received within this amount of time. If the cycle is aborted, the calibration status indicates this condition. The recommended range for calibration time out is 15 to 60 seconds. The default value is 15 seconds."
CalStepDelay="Calibration step delay is used during the calibration cycle as a software-selectable delay, assuring system stabilization prior to reading the flow rate. Calibration step delays depend on a number of system factors, such as line volume, transducer response, quick exhaust characteristics, and locations. The recommended range for calibration step delay is 200-1000 ms. The default value is 800ms"

FlowInTolTries="Flow in-tol trys is the number of detected ACCUFLOW samples that are within tolerance before making a table adjustment. The default value is 3."
IPSB="Independent Point Shift Band (IPSB) is used during the adaptive point update routine within ACCUFLOW. IPSB has comparison functions like the adaptive tolerance band, but instead of setting a status flag, IPSB reslopes the flow vs. command data. The benefit of IPSB is quicker response and update time when using a color that has shifted due to a change in viscosity. The IPSB is expressed as a percentage of change between the existing points on the dynamic table (for example, 300 = 30%). The range is 0-999, and IPSB defaults to +- 30% of the D/A counts between points."

KFTFactor="KFT Factor = ((cc's/pulse*10,000). A gear meter’s KFT factor relates to the volume of fluid displaced for every gear tooth that passes the sensor. KFT is used for the flow total. It is determined by beakering and comparing the beakered amount with the flow total read by AccuFlow. KFR is used for the flow rate and is calculated automatically by multiplying the KFT by 0.6. In AccuFlow, KFR is not a setup item. If necessary, the default value can be verified and corrected automatically by pressing F2, KFT CAL, at the Teach Pendant, after at least one color has been calibrated. The default value is 2366."
TriggerDelay="Trigger delay takes into account both the amount of time for a gun needle to retract after a GUN ON command and the amount of time for the flow to stabilize before closing the loop. The default value is 800."
FlowDelay="Flow delay is the amount of time the ACCUFLOW waits before closing the loop to allow for the flow to stabilize following a preset command change. The default value is 500."
TimeUp="The rate at which the system ramped up to the maximum flow rate requested when a calibration was performed. The engineering unit displayed is in milliseconds. The default value is 400ms/1000cnts."
TimeDown="The rate at which the system ramped down to the minimum flow rate requested when a calibration was performed. The engineering unit displayed is in milliseconds. The default value is 800ms/1000cnts."

AdaptiveTolerance="Adaptive tolerance specifies the tolerance band of transducer counts, (12-bit digital-to-analog converter = 200-1000). ACCUFLOW creates two tables for each point color calibrated. The initial calibration file is stored and copied to a second memory location. The second file becomes the dynamic table that gets its calibration data updated each time paint is flowing within tolerance. During production painting, the ACCUFLOW closed-loop function automatically adjusts the D/A command output count to yield the desired flow rate. The two files are compared constantly, and, in the event that the dynamic file output count should exceed the adaptive tolerance value (with reference to the original calibration table), a digital output flag is set. This function serves to indicate that something in the system has caused the control to adapt outside a realistic window. The causes of this situation include a fluid viscosity change, paint regulator malfunction, kinked or broken paint line, blocked fluid nozzle, or an open or leaking dump valve. ACCUFLOW will attempt to deliver the flow rate that has been commanded regardless of other system problems. Therefore, it is possible for the setpoint to be satisfied, even though the command has had to adapt considerably. The adaptive tolerance flag alerts the operator/engineer that something is not right within the system. The recommended range for adaptive tolerance is zero (0) to1000 D/A command counts. The default value is 80 counts."
MaxErrorFromSetpoint="This is the allowable flow rate error, (the difference between setpoint and actual flow), averaged over an entire production job at 1 second intervals. The default value is 6%."
MaxControlOut="This variable specifies the longest time that Accuflow will allow the control output to be at either extreme, (4 to 20 milliamps), and still not be able to reach setpoint flow rate before entering open loop mode for the rest of the job. Setting this output to zero (0) will disable this alarm. The engineering unit used here is milliseconds. The default value is 200ms."
MinSetpointReached="The maximum amount of time allowed for the Accuflow system to regain the setpoint reached output. If Accuflow cannot regain setpoint within this time, the Failed to Reach Setpoint alarm will be displayed. Setting this parameter to zero (0), will disable this alarm. The default value is 3000ms."
GracePeriod="A fixed period of gun on time at the beginning of a job during which flow rate errors will not be posted. This is used to prohibit Accuflow from posting errors caused from improper or incomplete color changes. The default value is 4000ms."
