PAINTworks III Master Help FileAuthor: Rick OlejniczakDate Created: 12/07/00Revision:0.1 Document Location: \\HQPSA01\Works006\pw3 development\paint\help\Master Help File.docAuthor		Date		Rev.		Area ChangedRJO		12/07/00		0.1		Initial documentIntroductionThe Master Help File is intended to be a starting point for creating a custom Help File for a PAINTworks III project. Because screen versions change and site-specific screens may be necessary, the Master Help component files must be updated to match the project. This document will describe the necessary changes and how to make them.ToolsOne of the best tools available at the time of this writing to modify PAINTworks III Help File component files is Microsoft FrontPage 2000. This program allows you to graphically edit the text, pictures and hotspots in html files. If FrontPage is not available, the html source can be edited with a text editor such as Notepad.How to Configure the Master Help File for a PW3 ProjectPAINTworks III Main Menu (Section 1.0)The Master Help File includes 5 "[1.0]PAINTWorksIIIMainMenu" template folders for different PAINTworks and Fluid Delivery System configurations at the time of this writing. Choose the one that most closely matches your project and delete the rest. Rename the folder you have chosen to "[1.0]PAINTWorksIIIMainMenu".Other Help SectionsThe Master Help includes html files and other related files for all types of fluid delivery systems, job ID systems, etc. that have previously been documented. In order to keep the size of your help file to a minimum, delete the sections that don't apply (example: If you are documenting an AccuFlow system, you won't need html and support files for IPC systems). Be sure to maintain the Master Help directory structure. Help system folders must have their current names in order to work properly. Don't for example arbitrarily  rename the ColorChangeAFBells folder to ColorChange just because you want to.Screen CapturesStarting from the Main Menu, review the html files for each of the screens and make sure that the screen captures match the versions at your site. If not, re-capture the screens with Paint Shop Pro and save them as JPEG (.jpg) files. The screen captures are located in the "images" folder in each help section. Make sure the name of the new screen capture .jpg file matches the name of the file you are updating. Also, make sure that the size of the image is the same as the one you are updating then copy it to the "images" folder for the help section you are working on.HotSpotsPre-existingI f you have updated the screen capture file for any of the help html files, verify that the HotSpots align properly with screen elements such as command buttons, text boxes, option buttons, etc. If they do not, their locations and sizes can be adjusted using FrontPage 2000 by right-clicking on the HotSpot objects and then dragging them to their proper locations or dragging their size handles to the proper dimensions. If FrontPage 2000 is not available, The HotSpot coordinates can be adjusted using a text editor. HotSpot definitions in the html files appear as follows:<area href="../[1.0]PAINTWorksIIIMainMenu/ConfigurationMenu.htm" shape="rect" coords="1, 2, 70, 64">The HotSpot coordinates are in the order "<Left>,<Top>,<Right>,<Bottom>" and can be adjusted by trial and error.NewIf  the screen capture includes new elements or if you wish to add additional pop-up text or links, hot spots can be added. With FrontPage 2000, select the Rectangular HotSpot tool from the pictures ToolBar, then position and size the HotSpot over the new element. FrontPage will now ask you for a Hyperlink URL. You can either browse or enter the path to another html document or enter a call to the common/help.js  Java Script file to pop-up text. A call to common/help.js will appear as follows:JavaScript:HHCTRL.TextPopup(PrintButton,popfont,9,9,-1,-1)In the example above, "PrintButton" is the tag in common/help.js that marks the PopUp text to be displayed. The corresponding text in common/help.js appears as follows:PrintButton="The print button sends the current screen's data to a formatted document."For new text that doesn't already exist in common/help.js, add a new line like the example above to the appropriate section in common/help.js. Make sure that the tag name, ("PrintButton" in the example) is unique. Sections in common/help.js that correspond to the screen captures where the PopUp text is used are marked by comments that appear as follows://Common, //Styles, //Options, etc.TextBe sure to  review the text in each of the Master Help html documents as well as the PopUp text for all HotSpots of this nature to make sure that it is as accurate and complete as possible.Changes to Master HelpIf you add anything to or revise your Help file that will benefit other members of the group, submit the changes to the GUI Coordinator for inclusion in the Master Help file. These types of changes might include error corrections, addition of new html documents and links to them, addition of descriptions or field definitions or sequences of operation, etc.PAINTworks III Master Help File
