<!--
Example search page for the JavaScript install of Zoom Search Engine 3.0

NOTE: that you should only use the JavaScript version if server-side
processing is not available, such as on a CD-ROM, local intranet, etc.

Client-side searching requires the entire index file to be downloaded
to the client, which is not an issue locally, or if your website is small,
but can be very slow for larger websites, over the Internet.

Hints:
1. Make sure you have indexed your website with the Zoom Indexer application
   with the "Javascript" option checked in the Configuration dialog. It
   should produce a file named "zoom_index.js" in your selected output directory.
2. Put this file (search.html), search.js, and zoom_index.js in the same directory
3. Copy or upload these files to your distribution medium (CD, server, etc)
3. Customise this page as you see fit. You can also put a search form on the
   other pages of your site (or navbar) by copying the form below.
