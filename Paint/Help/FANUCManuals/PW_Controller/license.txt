FANUC AMERICA CORPORATION
eDoc SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

1.  	AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND.  YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED 
	WITH THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("LICENSE") CONSTITUTES
 	YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY AND YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE
 	TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE.  IN THE EVENT THAT YOU 
	CHOOSE NOT TO ENTER INTO THIS LICENSE, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY 
	RETURN THE SOFTWARE UNUSED TO FANUC AMERICA CORPORATION.

2.  	GRANT OF LICENSE.  This License is non-exclusive and permits you to
	use one copy of FANUC America Corporation's Electronic Documentation 
	("SOFTWARE") on any single CPU.  If you have multiple Licenses for the 
	SOFTWARE, then at any time you may have as many copies of the SOFTWARE 
	in use as you have Licenses.  The SOFTWARE is "in use" on a CPU when 
	it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the 
	permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) 
	of that CPU.  If the anticipated number of users of the SOFTWARE will 
	exceed the number of applicable Licenses, then you must have a 
	reasonable mechanism or process in place to assure that the number of
 	persons using the SOFTWARE concurrently does not exceed the number of 
	Licenses.

3.  	COPYRIGHT.  The software and all of the rights associated with the 
	SOFTWARE are owned by FANUC America Corporation.  The SOFTWARE is protected 
	by United States copyright laws.  You must therefore treat the SOFTWARE 
	like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book or musical recording).  
	You may not copy the software in any form, in part or in whole, without 
	the written permission of an authorized FANUC America Corporation representative.    
	You may not copy any written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE.

4.  	TRADE SECRET PROTECTION.  The source code for the SOFTWARE is a trade secret
	of FANUC America Corporation.  You shall not reverse engineer or decompile 
	the SOFTWARE.  You shall safeguard proprietary information with respect 
	to the SOFTWARE furnished by FANUC America Corporation during the term of this 
	License, and shall limit the use of such information to the exercise of 
	the rights granted under this License.  You shall safeguard proprietary 
	information with respect to the SOFTWARE in accordance with the practices 
	and procedures and standards of care used to protect your own proprietary 	
	information of like nature, but at a minimum you shall use due care in 
	such safeguarding.  Your  obligations under this paragraph shall not 
	apply to information which:

	a) is released by FANUC America Corporation to others without restriction,
	b) is in the public domain,
	c) is independently developed or is received from others, without 
	   reference to the SOFTWARE and without violation of this License.

	If disclosed inadvertently despite the exercise of the degree of care 
	required under this paragraph, you will, at your expense, take all 
	necessary actions, legal or otherwise, necessary to recover the disclosed 	
	proprietary information.  This will include, but not be limited to, the 
	issuance of a restraining order until the information is recovered.

	5.  OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  This License Agreement is your proof of license 
	to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by you.  You may 
	not rent or lease the SOFTWARE.  Any transfer of the SOFTWARE, which must 
	be approved in writing by FANUC America Corporation, must include the most 
	recent update and all prior versions of the SOFTWARE.

	6.  U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the 
	U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in subparagraphs 
	(c)(1) and (c)(2) of the Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights 
	clause at FAR 52.227-19 or subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in 
	Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, as 
	applicable.

7.  	LIMITED WARRANTY.  FANUC America Corporation warrants only that the SOFTWARE 
	will perform substantially in accordance with the SOFTWARE's written 
	instructions for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery to your 
	facility, and you accept the SOFTWARE subject to this limited warranty.  
	FANUC AMERICA CORPORATION EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER 
	WARRANTIES RESPECTING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE, 
	INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY 
	OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	
8.  	NO LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  IN NO 
	EVENT SHALL FANUC AMERICA CORPORATION BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES 
	WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS 
	OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS 
	INFORMATION, OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
	OF, MISUSE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF FANUC 
	AMERICA CORPORATION HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
	DAMAGES.  BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL 
	DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

9.  	CUSTOMER REMEDIES.  FANUC America Corporation's entire liability and your 
	exclusive remedy in the event of a warranty claim shall be, at FANUC America 
	Corporation's option, either (a) return of the price paid or (b) repair 
	or replacement of the SOFTWARE that is returned to FANUC America Corporation 
	with a copy of your receipt.

10. 	TERMINATION.  If FANUC America Corporation has knowledge of facts indicating 
	that you are in breach of any obligations of this License, notice shall be 
	given to you requiring correction thereof within 30 days.  Should you fail 
	to make correction in the allotted time, FANUC America Corporation may elect to
	terminate this License by giving you at least 30 days written notice of termination.

	Upon termination, you will return, at no cost to FANUC America Corporation, the 
	SOFTWARE, all documentation and other data relating to the SOFTWARE, and 
	you will refrain thereafter from using the SOFTWARE or any modification 
	or improvement thereof without first obtaining FANUC America Corporation's written 
	consent.  FANUC America Corporation shall have all other rights under existing laws 
	against you arising from the breach of your obligations under this License 
	including payment of actual damages sustained by FANUC America Corporation.  
	Should either party bring any action to enforce the terms of this License, the 
	prevailing party shall be entitled to all costs incurred in bringing such 
	action including reasonable attorney fees.

11. 	CONSTRUCTION.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between you 
	and FANUC America Corporation relating to the SOFTWARE and is binding upon any 
	successors and transferees.  No change shall be made in any of the terms 
	contained herein, nor any provision waived, without the written agreement 
	of both parties, and that written document must reference this License 
	Agreement directly and by name in order to supersede any agreement stated 
	herein.  This License will be construed and interpreted in accordance with 
	the laws of the State of Michigan.  You agree not to utilize the SOFTWARE 
	for any purpose which is contrary to the laws of any government having 
	jurisdiction over you or FANUC America Corporation.

12. 	MISCELLANEOUS.  This License shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit 
	of, the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns; provided, 
	however, you may not assign this License without the prior written consent 
	of FANUC America Corporation. If any portion of this License is wholly or partially 
	unenforceable, for any reasons, such unenforceability shall not affect 
	the balance hereof.
